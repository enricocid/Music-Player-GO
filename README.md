# Features:

### Unifield UI, the way I'd like it to be:

- Colorful, simple and 'unified'UI : no need to navigate between activities;
- Bottom panel containing the player controls;
- Music organized by artist;
- Top panel containing the now played song and a toggle the reveal layout;
- Reveal layout containing the selected artist's discography; 
- Fast scrolling;
- Dark status bar icons for light accents
- Ability to play all the songs from the device or from an artist;

### Open settings directly on the UI. Available settings: 

- Themes (light and inverted)
- Link to git page;
- 16 UI accents!;

### Minimal code:

*Based on nothing: it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there*

### What does this cost?
*Music Player GO will always be free! Anyway, you can still buy me a beer, an ice cream or something via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/enricocid) if You really liked it! :)*

### Dependencies used: 

  - Android Support Library v4;

  - RecyclerView v7;

  - CardView v7;

  - RecyclerView-FastScroll by Tim Malseed (@timusus) (https://github.com/timusus/RecyclerView-FastScroll)

### Other features: 

- Pause/resume when the headsets are (dis)connected;
- Simple audio focus (notifications, calls, or other media apps) management;
