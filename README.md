Very slim Music Player (878KB)!

- Very simple UI "Everything in one UI", the way I'd like it to be:

Music is organized by artist and a sliding up panel containing controls (when collapsed) and the artist albums/songs (when expanded) is present.  No need to navigate between activities;

-  Open settings directly from UI thanks to an elegant circular reveal animation. Available settings: 

UI inversion and equalizer;

- Minimal code:

The player is based on nothing and it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there. 
Used dependencies: sliding up panel by @umano (https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel), Android Support v4, RecyclerView;

- Other features: 

Pause/resume when the headsets are (dis)connected and simple audio focus (notifications, calls, or other media apps) management;
