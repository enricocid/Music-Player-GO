### Unifield UI, the way I'd like it to be:

- Colorful and simple UI;
- Unified UI: no need to navigate between activities;
- Music organized by artist;
- Alphabetic scrolling;
- Sliding up panel containing controls (when collapsed) and the artist albums/songs (when expanded);
- Dark status bar icons for light accents
(according to https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette);

### Open settings directly from UI. Available settings: 

- Equalizer;
- Themes (Light, dark, night)(Long click to force night theme);
- Link to git page;
- UI accents;


### Minimal code:

- Based on nothing: it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there;


### What does this cost?
Music Player GO will always be free! Anyway, you can still buy me a beer, an ice cream or something via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/enricocid) if You really liked it! :)


### Dependencies used: 

  - Android Support Library v4;
  - RecyclerView v7;

  - Sliding up panel by @umano opportunely modified by Me (https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel) (animated arrow indicator, lightened and with deprecated methods replaced);
  - Alphabetic Index Fast Scroller by @myinnos opportunely modified by Me to be shown/hidden on RecyclerView's scroll (https://github.com/myinnos/AlphabetIndex-Fast-Scroll-RecyclerView);

### Other features: 

- Pause/resume when the headsets are (dis)connected;
- Simple audio focus (notifications, calls, or other media apps) management;
